        <p>The end-of-the-year theme-off- better known by fellow staff members as EOTYTO. It was our yearly tradition where we would get into groups and brainstorm common themes pertaining to the incoming graduating class or special events happening in the upcoming school year. My group's proposed theme was "Here We Are", which focused on highlighting culture on both a holistic and individual scale.</p>
